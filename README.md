# Project Title
*FedEx Logistics Performance Analysis*

# Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of logistics performance at FedEx, focusing on delivery efficiency, vendor performance, shipment costs, and regional insights. By using tools like Python, Pandas, and PowerBI, this analysis identifies key logistics metrics, such as on-time delivery rate, average delivery time, and freight costs by shipment mode. The findings are presented through interactive visualizations, enabling strategic improvements in delivery processes and cost optimization.

# Project Objectives

- Analyze on-time delivery rates and identify trends in delivery performance.
- Assess vendor performance in terms of value and quantity shipped.
- Optimize shipment mode selection based on freight costs and delivery efficiency.
- Provide actionable insights at the country and regional levels for logistics operations.

# Data Overview
- Source: FedEx logistics data
- Key Columns: Scheduled Delivery Date, Delivered to Client Date, Vendor, Shipment Mode, -Country, Line Item Quantity, Line Item Value, Freight Cost (USD), Line Item Insurance (USD), etc.
- Dataset Size: Contains detailed logistics records for shipments, vendors, and regions.

# Analysis Workflow

- Data Cleaning: Address missing values and ensure data consistency.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze delivery timelines, vendor contributions, and cost patterns.
- Data Visualization: Use PowerBI to create interactive visualizations for insights into logistics performance.
- Insights and Recommendations: Highlight findings to support strategic logistics improvements.

# Key Metrics and Measures
- OnTimeDeliveryRate: Percentage of deliveries made on or before the scheduled date.
- TotalLineItemValue: Sum of all line item values for assessing overall value delivered.
- TotalLineItemQuantity: Total quantity of items shipped.
- AvgUnitPrice: Average unit price across shipments.
- InsurancePercentage: Insurance as a percentage of total line item value.
- LateDeliveryCount: Number of deliveries that missed the scheduled delivery date.

# Key Insights
- Delivery Performance: Trends in on-time vs. late deliveries over time.
- Vendor Analysis: Identification of top-performing vendors by value and quantity shipped.
- Cost Efficiency: Freight cost analysis by shipment mode (air, sea, etc.) for cost optimization.
- Geographical Insights: Performance and delivery times across different countries and regions.
